# Expand troubleshooting with common error solutions

## Overview

The current troubleshooting section in README.md and docs/database.md covers only 3 common problems. There's no FAQ, no error message reference, and no debugging guide for service integration issues (LDAP connection failures, Genesys OAuth errors, Graph API permission problems).

## Rationale

Help desk staff and administrators encounter various errors in production. Without comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, they escalate to developers for routine issues. A good troubleshooting guide reduces support burden and improves incident response time.
