  "description": "The search endpoint at app/blueprints/search/search_refactored.py accepts search terms with only `.strip()` applied. While LDAP injection is prevented by escape_filter_chars() in ldap_service.py, there are no length limits or character restrictions on search input, which could cause resource exhaustion.",
