  "description": "# Automated Test Suite Implementation\n\nImplement comprehensive pytest-based testing framework with unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints, and fixture management for database testing. This addresses a critical technical debt item identified in the codebase.\n\n## Rationale\nTesting infrastructure is essential for maintaining code quality and enabling confident refactoring. Without tests, changes risk breaking existing functionality. Enterprise IAM competitors like SailPoint require extensive customization (pain-sp-6) - having solid tests ensures WhoDis remains reliable and easy to maintain.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want to run automated tests so that I can verify changes don't break existing functionality\n- As a maintainer, I want test coverage reports so that I can identify untested code paths\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] pytest configured in requirements.txt and working with 'pytest' command\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for core services (ldap_service, graph_service, genesys_service)\n- [ ] Integration tests exist for search endpoints\n- [ ] Test coverage report available (minimum 60% coverage for services)\n- [ ] CI-compatible test configuration (can run headless)\n- [ ] Database fixtures support test isolation\n",
