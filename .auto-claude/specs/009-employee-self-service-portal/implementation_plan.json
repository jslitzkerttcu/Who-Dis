  "description": "# Employee Self-Service Portal\n\nCreate a limited self-service portal where employees can view their own identity information, see their assigned roles/groups across systems, and verify their access is correct. No edit capability - read-only for self.\n\n## Rationale\nEmployees often contact IT just to verify what access they have. Self-service reduces help desk burden while empowering employees. This is a known gap in current WhoDis. Simpler than full IAM self-service (avoiding SailPoint complexity) but still valuable for reducing tickets.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an employee, I want to see my own access information so that I can verify I have the right permissions\n- As a contact center agent, I want to see my skills and queues so that I can confirm my routing is correct\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Separate portal at /self-service accessible to all authenticated users\n- [ ] User can view their own profile: AD info, Graph info, Genesys info\n- [ ] User can see their group memberships across all systems\n- [ ] User can see their Genesys skills and queues\n- [ ] User can see their job code and expected roles (if in compliance matrix)\n- [ ] No ability to search for other users (only self)\n- [ ] Optional: Link to request access changes (integration with ticketing)\n",
