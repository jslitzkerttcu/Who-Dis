  "task_description": "# Bulk User Export\n\nAllow administrators to export search results and user data to CSV/Excel format for reporting, compliance documentation, and integration with external systems.\n\n## Rationale\nCompliance audits and HR reporting often require user data exports. Currently this requires manual copying. Enterprise competitors have 'weak customization' and 'limited reporting' (pain-gen-5, pain-sp-6) - easy export fills a common gap. Self-hosted WhoDis can provide data without vendor dependencies.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an IT security analyst, I want to export user data to CSV so that I can analyze it in Excel for compliance reports\n- As an HR administrator, I want to export employee access data so that I can document quarterly access reviews\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Export button available on search results page for Admin/Editor roles\n- [ ] Export includes all displayed fields (AD, Graph, Genesys data)\n- [ ] CSV format with proper escaping and UTF-8 encoding\n- [ ] Excel (.xlsx) format option available\n- [ ] Export includes timestamp and search criteria metadata\n- [ ] Audit log entry created for each export operation\n",
