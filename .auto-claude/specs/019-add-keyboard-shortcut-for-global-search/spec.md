Implement a keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + K or /) that focuses the search input from any page, enabling power users to quickly initiate searches without mouse interaction.

## Rationale

IT Help Desk staff perform repeated searches throughout the day. Keyboard shortcuts significantly improve productivity for repetitive actions. This pattern is standard in modern applications (GitHub, Slack, VS Code).
