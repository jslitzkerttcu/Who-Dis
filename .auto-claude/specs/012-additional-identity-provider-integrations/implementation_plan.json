  "description": "# Additional Identity Provider Integrations\n\nExtend WhoDis to integrate with additional identity providers beyond AD/Graph/Genesys. Potential integrations: Duo (MFA status), UKG/Workforce management, AWS IAM (for technical staff), ServiceNow (ticketing correlation).\n\n## Rationale\nOrganizations have identity data spread across many systems. Each integration increases WhoDis's value as the 'single pane of glass' for identity. Addresses market gap (gap-6) for real-time concurrent search across multiple providers. Modular integration architecture enables customer-specific extensions.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an IT admin, I want to see MFA enrollment status from Duo so that I can verify security compliance\n- As an HR administrator, I want to see UKG data alongside AD data so that I can verify employee status\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Modular integration architecture with plugin-style identity providers\n- [ ] Configuration UI for enabling/disabling integrations\n- [ ] At least one new integration implemented (priority: UKG for HR data correlation)\n- [ ] New integrations appear in search results with clear source tagging\n- [ ] Integration health monitoring in admin dashboard\n- [ ] Documentation for developing custom integrations\n- [ ] Timeout protection and graceful degradation for new integrations\n",
