# Add CONTRIBUTING.md with developer onboarding guide

## Overview

The project lacks a CONTRIBUTING.md file to guide new developers or contributors. There is no documented process for setting up a development environment, running tests, submitting changes, or understanding code review expectations. CLAUDE.md exists but is AI-focused rather than human-developer focused.

## Rationale

New team members need to quickly understand how to contribute code. Without a CONTRIBUTING.md, onboarding takes longer as developers must discover conventions through trial and error or by asking others. This is critical for team scaling and reducing institutional knowledge dependency.
