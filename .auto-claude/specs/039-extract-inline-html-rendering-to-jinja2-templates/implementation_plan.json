  "description": "There are 26+ _render_* functions across the codebase generating HTML strings directly in Python code. The largest offenders are in search/__init__.py (15 functions, ~1400 lines of HTML) and admin/database.py (10 functions, ~800 lines of HTML). This violates separation of concerns and makes the HTML difficult to maintain.",
