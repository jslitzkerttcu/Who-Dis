  "task_description": "# Compliance Violation Detection & Reporting\n\nEnhance job role compliance matrix with automated detection of role violations, visual compliance dashboard, and exportable compliance reports for auditors.\n\n## Rationale\nManual compliance checking is error-prone and time-consuming. Credit union regulatory requirements demand robust access controls. This addresses a key differentiator (credit union compliance needs not met by generic IAM per gap-5) and strengthens WhoDis's unique value proposition for financial services.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a compliance officer, I want automated violation detection so that I don't miss access control issues\n- As an auditor, I want exportable compliance reports so that I can include them in audit documentation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Automated daily scan comparing actual roles to expected roles per job code\n- [ ] Compliance dashboard showing: Compliant users %, Violations by type, Trend over time\n- [ ] Violation types: Missing required role, Excessive privileges, Unknown job code\n- [ ] Violation drill-down with user details and specific role mismatches\n- [ ] Export compliance report in format suitable for auditors (PDF with attestation)\n- [ ] Email notification to compliance team on new violations detected\n- [ ] Bulk action to generate access review tickets for violations\n",
