  "task_description": "# Automated Notifications & Alerts\n\nImplement comprehensive notification system with configurable alerts for identity-related events: password expiring, account locked, compliance violation, new employee detected, terminated employee access remaining.\n\n## Rationale\nProactive notifications prevent issues before users are impacted.
