  "task_description": "# Access Request Workflow\n\nImplement workflow system for access requests that integrates with the existing job role compliance matrix. Employees or managers can request access, requests route to appropriate approvers, and approval/denial is tracked.\n\n## Rationale\nManual access provisioning is slow and lacks audit trail. Workflow automation reduces time-to-access while maintaining compliance controls. This addresses the 'no workflow automation' known gap and provides value beyond simple lookup - moving toward lightweight IAM functionality.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an employee, I want to request access through WhoDis so that I don't have to email IT\n- As a manager, I want to approve team access requests so that provisioning is faster\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Access request form accessible from self-service portal\n- [ ] Request types: AD group, Genesys skill/queue, Generic access request\n- [ ] Approval routing based on configurable rules (manager, role owner, security)\n- [ ] Multi-level approval support for sensitive access\n- [ ] Email notifications at each workflow step\n- [ ] Request status tracking visible to requester and approvers\n- [ ] Completed requests logged in audit trail with full approval chain\n- [ ] Integration with job role compliance to flag requests outside expected roles\n",
