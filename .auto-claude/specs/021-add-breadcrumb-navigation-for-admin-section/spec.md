# Add Breadcrumb Navigation for Admin Section

## Overview

Implement breadcrumb navigation in admin pages to show hierarchical context (e.g., Admin > User Management > Edit User) and enable quick navigation to parent sections.

## Rationale

The admin section has multiple levels (Admin Index > Feature Page > Detail/Modal). Currently users can only navigate back using the 'Back to Admin' button. Breadcrumbs provide clear location context and multiple navigation options.
