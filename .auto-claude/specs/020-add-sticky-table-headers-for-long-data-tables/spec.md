# Add Sticky Table Headers for Long Data Tables

## Overview

Implement sticky headers on data tables (User Management, Audit Logs, Employee Profiles, Blocked Numbers) so column headers remain visible when scrolling through many rows.

## Rationale

Admin pages often display 50+ rows of data. When scrolling, users lose context of which column contains what data. This is especially problematic in Audit Logs where multiple similar-looking columns exist (timestamps, IPs, emails).
