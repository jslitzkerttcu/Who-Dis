  "task_description": "# Search History & Favorites\n\nEnable users to view their recent search history and save frequently-searched users as favorites for quick access. History is stored per-user with configurable retention period.\n\n## Rationale\nIT help desk staff often search for the same users repeatedly during ticket resolution. Quick access to recent and favorite searches significantly reduces time spent on identity lookups. This addresses the pain point that enterprise IAM search requires technical skills (pain-sp-4) by making common lookups instant.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an IT help desk agent, I want to see my recent searches so that I can quickly re-lookup users I was helping earlier\n- As a contact center manager, I want to save my team members as favorites so that I can check their Genesys status quickly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can view their last 20 searches with timestamps\n- [ ] Users can click a history item to re-run the search\n- [ ] Users can mark search results as favorites (star icon)\n- [ ] Favorites appear in a dedicated section above search results\n- [ ] History and favorites persist across sessions\n- [ ] Users can clear their history and remove favorites\n",
