# Add Escape Key Handler for All Modals

## Overview

Implement consistent keyboard escape key handling for all modal dialogs, allowing users to close modals by pressing Escape in addition to clicking the close button or clicking outside.

## Rationale

Multiple modals exist (Edit User, Note Modal, Audit Detail, Add Blocked Number, Delete Confirm) that only close on click-outside or close button click. Keyboard users expect Escape to close modals - this is standard UX and a WCAG accessibility recommendation.
