# Implement Complete LogRepository with Interface

## Overview

Complete the LogRepository implementation to fully implement ILogRepository interface, similar to how CacheRepository implements ICacheRepository. Add proper abstraction for all log operations.

## Rationale

The ILogRepository interface exists in app/interfaces/log_repository.py. CacheRepository shows the complete implementation pattern with interface implementation. LogRepository exists but may not fully implement the interface. This is about completing an existing pattern.
