  "task_description": "# Advanced Search Filters\n\nExtend search capabilities with filters for department, location, account status, Genesys skills, and date ranges (hire date, password expiration). Filters persist across searches.\n\n## Rationale\nWhile simple search is a key differentiator vs. complex IAM tools, power users need filtering for specific lookup scenarios. This maintains simplicity for basic searches while enabling advanced use cases. Addresses Microsoft's 'feature relocation' frustration (pain-entra-1) by providing stable, consistent filter interface.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an IT admin, I want to filter by department so that I can find all users in a specific business unit\n- As a contact center manager, I want to filter by Genesys skill so that I can see all agents with specific capabilities\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Filter panel available via toggle button on search page\n- [ ] Filters include: Department, Location, Account Status (enabled/disabled), Genesys Skills\n- [ ] Date range filters for: Hire Date, Password Expiration, Last Logon\n- [ ] Filters can be combined (AND logic)\n- [ ] Active filters displayed as chips that can be removed\n- [ ] Filters persist in user session across page refreshes\n",
