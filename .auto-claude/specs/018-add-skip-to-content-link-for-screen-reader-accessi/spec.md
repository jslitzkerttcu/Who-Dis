# Add Skip-to-Content Link for Screen Reader Accessibility

## Overview

Add a visually hidden skip link at the top of the page that becomes visible on focus, allowing keyboard and screen reader users to skip the navigation and jump directly to main content.

## Rationale

Skip links are a WCAG 2.1 Level A requirement. Currently, keyboard users must tab through all navigation items before reaching main content, which is frustrating and time-consuming for users with motor impairments or those using screen readers.
