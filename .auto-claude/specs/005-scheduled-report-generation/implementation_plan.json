  "description": "# Scheduled Report Generation\n\nEnable administrators to configure scheduled reports that run automatically and are delivered via email or saved to designated locations. Reports include search analytics, compliance summaries, and audit trails.\n\n## Rationale\nManual report generation is time-consuming and often forgotten. Scheduled reports ensure compliance documentation stays current. Addresses the 'limited reporting' pain point seen in Genesys (pain-gen-5) and need for compliance evidence. Reduces dependency on IT staff for routine reporting.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an IT manager, I want weekly usage reports so that I can track WhoDis adoption without manual effort\n- As a compliance officer, I want monthly compliance summaries so that I can include them in audit packages\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Admin interface for creating/managing scheduled reports\n- [ ] Schedule options: daily, weekly, monthly, custom cron expression\n- [ ] Report types: Search Usage Analytics, Compliance Summary, Audit Log Export\n- [ ] Delivery options: Email (with attachment) or save to configured location\n- [ ] Report templates customizable (fields, filters, format)\n- [ ] Report execution history with status and download links\n- [ ] Failed report notifications to admin\n",
