      "description": "Add a visually hidden skip link at the top of the page that becomes visible on focus, allowing keyboard and screen reader users to skip the navigation and jump directly to main content.",
      "rationale": "Skip links are a WCAG 2.1 Level A requirement. Currently, keyboard users must tab through all navigation items before reaching main content, which is frustrating and time-consuming for users with motor impairments or those using screen readers.",
      "category": "accessibility",
      "affected_components": ["app/templates/base.html"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "No skip-to-content link exists. Keyboard users must tab through Home, Search, Utilities dropdown, Admin links, and user info before reaching main content - approximately 8-12 tab stops per page.",
      "proposed_change": "Add a visually hidden skip link as the first focusable element in the body: <a href='#main-content' class='sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:bg-white focus:px-4 focus:py-2 focus:rounded-md focus:shadow-lg'>Skip to main content</a>. Add id='main-content' to the <main> element.",
      "user_benefit": "Screen reader users and keyboard navigators can skip repetitive navigation on every page, improving efficiency and reducing frustration. Essential for users with motor impairments who find repeated tabbing difficult.",

      "current_state": "Users must click on the Search navigation link, wait for page load, then click or tab to the search input. No keyboard-driven quick access exists.",
      "proposed_change": "Add a global keyboard listener in base.html that: 1) Listens for Cmd/Ctrl+K or / key, 2) If on search page, focuses the search input directly, 3) If on another page, navigates to search page with autofocus. Add a visual indicator (e.g., 'Press / to search') near navigation. Implementation: document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => { if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'k') { e.preventDefault(); focusOrNavigateSearch(); } });",
      "user_benefit": "Power users can initiate searches instantly from any page without moving hands from keyboard. Reduces time-to-search by 3-5 seconds per lookup, saving significant time over hundreds of daily searches.",

For tables within scrollable containers, ensure the container has 'overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-300px)]' and the thead has 'sticky top-0'. Add a subtle shadow on scroll for visual separation.",
