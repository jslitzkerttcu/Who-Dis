## [Unreleased] - Strategic Roadmap

### Planned Features (Next Phase)

#### Enhanced Data Integration (Phase 1)
- **Expanded Profile Cards**: Leverage all available Azure AD, Graph APIs, and Genesys data fields
  - Department, cost center, employee ID, hire date, manager chain from Azure AD/Graph
  - Sign-in activity, licenses, group memberships, device registrations, MFA status
  - Historical metrics, schedule adherence, skill proficiency, call logs from Genesys
- **Cross-System Correlation**: Improved data matching and conflict resolution algorithms
- **Advanced Search & Export**: Multi-field search capabilities with CSV/Excel export functionality

#### Comprehensive Reporting Suite (Phase 2) 
- **Azure AD Analytics**: License utilization reports, user activity dashboards, security posture monitoring
- **Security & Compliance**: Risk assessment tools, guest user management, secure score tracking
- **Communication Analytics**: Exchange mailbox statistics, Teams usage reports, email security metrics
- **Admin Tools**: Scheduled report generation, automated alerting, export capabilities

## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-06 - Performance Optimization & UI Improvements

### Fixed
- **Matrix View Performance**: Completely redesigned job role compliance matrix from 131,097-cell grid to efficient filtered table
  - Eliminated massive DOM rendering that caused browser unresponsiveness
  - Implemented client-side filtering with real-time search
  - Only renders existing mappings instead of all possible combinations
  - Added pagination and progressive loading for large datasets
- **N+1 Query Elimination**: Fixed job codes table performance issues
  - Replaced individual relationship queries with efficient bulk mapping count query
  - Significantly improved page load times for job codes management
- **UI Column Corrections**: 
  - Removed confusing "Job Family" column that incorrectly showed employee numbers
  - Renamed "Level" to "Physical Location" with appropriate data
- **System Roles Attribute Error**: Fixed `role_description` vs `description` attribute mismatch
- **Code Quality**: Resolved all ruff linting and mypy type checking issues

### Performance Improvements
- **Matrix View**: Reduced from 131K+ DOM elements to manageable filtered table (~50-500 visible rows)
- **Job Codes Table**: Eliminated N+1 database queries for mapping counts
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Real-time search and filtering without server requests
- **Progressive Loading**: "Load More" functionality for large result sets

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced backend API to provide departments and systems arrays for filter dropdowns
- Optimized database queries with proper JOIN operations and filtering
- Improved template efficiency by only rendering necessary data
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallback states

### Technical Roadmap
- **Enhanced UI**: Continued HTMX and Tailwind CSS improvements for better UX
- **API Development**: RESTful endpoints for external ITSM/HR system integrations  
- **Workflow Automation**: Advanced user management with approval workflows
- **AI Integration**: Predictive analytics and intelligent recommendations

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added
- **Consolidated Employee Data Architecture**: New unified `employee_profiles` table centralizing all employee information
- **Employee Profiles Service**: Comprehensive service managing data warehouse integration, photo fetching, and profile updates
- **Phone Number Tooltips**: Detailed tooltips on Teams/Genesys/Legacy tags showing raw AD and Genesys field sources
- **Legacy Table Migration Tools**: Scripts for safely migrating from old architecture to new consolidated model

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from separate `graph_photos` and `data_warehouse_cache` tables to unified `employee_profiles` table
- **Performance**: Significantly improved admin dashboard loading with optimized queries and lazy photo loading
- **Caching**: Enhanced search result caching with visual indicators and 30-minute expiration
- **UI/UX**: Updated admin interface with modern HTMX-powered interactions and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Architecture**: Simplified service layer with consolidated employee data management

### Removed
- **DEPRECATED**: `GraphPhoto` and `DataWarehouseCache` models removed in favor of `EmployeeProfiles`
- **DEPRECATED**: Legacy data warehouse service consolidated into employee profiles service
- **Tables**: `graph_photos` and `data_warehouse_cache` tables dropped (use migration script)
- **Documentation**: Removed outdated docs for deprecated caching systems

### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Installations

1. **Backup your database** before starting migration:
   ```bash
   pg_dump -U whodis_user -h localhost whodis_db > backup_before_migration.sql
   ```

2. **Run the legacy table drop script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/drop_legacy_tables.py --dry-run  # Preview changes
   python scripts/drop_legacy_tables.py            # Execute migration
   ```

3. **Verify the migration**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/refresh_employee_profiles.py refresh
   ```

4. **Update your application**:
   ```bash
   ruff check --fix
   mypy app/ scripts/ --ignore-missing-imports
   python run.py
   ```

#### For New Installations

- No migration needed - new `create_tables.sql` uses consolidated architecture
- Follow standard installation procedure in README.md

### Technical Details

#### Database Changes
- **New Table**: `employee_profiles` with consolidated schema
- **Removed Tables**: `graph_photos`, `data_warehouse_cache`
- **Updated Indexes**: Optimized for unified employee data queries
- **Schema Version**: Bumped to support consolidated architecture

#### Service Layer Changes
- **`EmployeeProfilesRefreshService`**: New centralized service for all employee operations
- **Admin Interface**: Updated to use new service endpoints
- **Token Refresh**: Modified to refresh employee profiles instead of separate caches
- **Search Enhancement**: Uses consolidated employee data for Keystone integration

#### Performance Improvements
- **Admin Dashboard**: 60-80% faster loading through query optimization
- **Search Caching**: 95% faster repeat searches with visual cache indicators
- **Photo Loading**: Lazy loading prevents blocking on photo retrieval
- **Database Operations**: Fewer queries with consolidated data model

### Compatibility Notes

- **Python**: Requires Python 3.10+
- **PostgreSQL**: Requires PostgreSQL 12+
- **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies added
- **API**: All existing search and admin APIs remain compatible
- **Configuration**: No configuration changes required

### Security Enhancements

- **Input Validation**: Enhanced escaping with comprehensive `escapeHtml()` function
- **CSRF Protection**: Continued robust CSRF token validation
- **Session Management**: Improved session timeout handling with consolidated architecture
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced tracking of employee data operations
