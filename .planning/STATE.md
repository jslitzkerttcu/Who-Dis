# Project State: WhoDis v3.0

**Project:** WhoDis v3.0 — IT Operations Platform
**Initialized:** 2026-04-24
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-24

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** IT staff can find everything about any employee and act on it from a single interface — no switching between AD, Azure portal, Genesys admin, or M365 admin center.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation (tech debt cleanup, security hardening, operational primitives)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 — Foundation
**Plan:** None started
**Status:** Not started
**Progress:** [----------] 0/8 phases complete

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Locked In
- Test suite (Phase 2) ships before write operations (Phase 6) — tests are the safety net for higher-risk ops
- Reports blueprint (Phase 5) builds its own shared infrastructure — REPT-01/02 are the foundation for REPT-06/07 scheduling
- API (Phase 7) starts read-only — write endpoints are v2+ scope
- Operational hardening items (OPS-01..04, SEC-01..04, DEBT-01..04) grouped in Phase 1 to clean the slate before feature work

### Architecture Constraints
- Flask/PostgreSQL/HTMX only — no new frameworks introduced
- All new endpoints use existing `@auth_required` + `@require_role` decorators
- All write operations require confirmation modal + audit trail + role check (editor minimum)
- Container-based DI — new services registered in `app/container.py`

### Known Concerns to Address by Phase
- Phase 1: `app_factory.py` duplication (DEBT-01), `DataWarehouseService` removal (DEBT-02), asyncio patterns (DEBT-04), `.whodis_salt` in git history (SEC-01), missing health check (OPS-01)
- Phase 2: Zero test coverage baseline — result_merger.py (537 lines), search_orchestrator.py (332 lines) are highest priority
- Phase 6: Write ops against AD require Graph API additional permissions — document per operation

### Blockers / Risks
- None at initialization — Phase 1 has no external dependencies

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-04-24 — Roadmap created from requirements
**Next action:** Run `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to decompose Phase 1 into executable plans
